Worst-Fit Algorithm
The Worst-Fit Algorithm is a memory management technique used to allocate processes to memory blocks. It works by always selecting the largest available memory block that can accommodate the process. The idea is to leave the largest remaining free space for future allocations.
How It Works
Input: A list of memory blocks (with sizes) and a list of processes (with memory requirements).
Find Block: For each process, find the largest memory block that is large enough to fit the process.
Allocate: Assign the process to this block and reduce the block size by the process's memory requirement.
Repeat: Continue until all processes are allocated or no suitable blocks are available.
Advantages
Reduces fragmentation by leaving larger free memory blocks.
Useful when large processes are expected in the future.
Disadvantages
Can lead to inefficient use of memory as smaller processes may not utilize the largest blocks efficiently.
May increase external fragmentation over time.
Example
Given memory blocks: [100, 500, 200, 300, 600]
Processes: [212, 417, 112, 426]
Allocation result:
Process 212 -> Block 600
Process 417 -> Block 500
Process 112 -> Block 300
Process 426 -> Allocation fails (no block large enough)
Applications
Used in operating systems for dynamic memory allocation.
Helps in understanding memory fragmentation and allocation strategies.
